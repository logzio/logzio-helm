# Logzio-otel-k8s-metrics

##  Overview

You can use a Helm chart to ship Kubernetes logs to Logz.io via the OpenTelemetry collector.
The Helm tool is used to manage packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources that use charts.

**logzio-otel-k8s-metrics** allows you to ship metrics from your Kubernetes cluster to Logz.io with the OpenTelemetry collector.

**Note:** This chart is a fork of the [opentelemtry-collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/opentelemetry-collector) Helm chart. 
It is also dependent on the [kube-state-metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/tree/master/charts/kube-state-metrics) and [prometheus-node-exporter](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/prometheus-node-exporter) charts, which are installed by default. 
To disable the dependency during installation, set `kubeStateMetrics.enabled` and `nodeExporter` to `false`.

#### Before installing the chart
Check if you have any taints on your nodes:

```
kubectl get nodes -o json | jq '"\(.items[].metadata.name) \(.items[].spec.taints)"'
```
if you do, please add them as tolerations in values.yaml tolerations.


#### Standard configuration


##### Deploy the Helm chart
First add `logzio-helm` repo
```shell
helm repo add logzio-helm https://logzio.github.io/logzio-helm
helm repo update
```

To deploy the Helm chart, enter the relevant parameters for the placeholders and run the code. 

###### Configure the parameters in the code

Replace the Logz-io `<<PROMETHEUS-METRICS-SHIPPING-TOKEN>>` with the [token](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-tokens/data-shipping) of the metrics account to which you want to send your data.


Replace `<<LISTENER-HOST>>` with your region’s listener host (for example, `https://listener.logz.io:8053`). For more information on finding your account’s region, see [Account region](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html).

Replace `<<ENV-TAG>>` with the name for the environment's metrics, to easily identify the metrics for each environment.

###### Run the Helm deployment code for clusters with no Windows Nodes

```
helm install  \
--set secrets.MetricsToken=<<PROMETHEUS-METRICS-SHIPPING-TOKEN>> \
--set secrets.ListenerHost=<<LISTENER-HOST>> \
--set secrets.p8s_logzio_name=<<ENV-TAG>> \
logzio-otel-k8s-metrics logzio-helm/logzio-otel-k8s-metrics
```

#### For clusters with Windows Nodes

In order to extract and scrape metrics from Windows Nodes, a Windows Exporter service must first be installed on the node host itself. We will do this by authenticating with username and password using SSH connection to the node through a job.

By default, the Windows installer job will run on deployment and every 10 minutes, and will keep the most recent failed and successful pods.
You can change these setting in values.yaml:
```
windowsExporterInstallerJob:
  interval: "*/10 * * * *"           #In CronJob format
  successfulJobsHistoryLimit: 1
  failedJobsHistoryLimit: 1
```

The default username for windows Node pools is: azureuser. (Username and password are shared across all windows nodepools)

You can change your Windows node pool password in AKS cluster with the following command (will only affect Windows node pools):

```
    az aks update \
    --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP \
    --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
    --windows-admin-password $NEW_PW
```

You can read more information at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/windows-faq,
under `How do I change the administrator password for Windows Server nodes on my cluster?` section.


###### Run the Helm deployment code for clusters with Windows Nodes:

```
helm install  \
--set secrets.MetricsToken=<<PROMETHEUS-METRICS-SHIPPING-TOKEN>> \
--set secrets.ListenerHost=<<LISTENER-HOST>> \
--set secrets.p8s_logzio_name=<<ENV-TAG>> \
--set secrets.windowsNodeUsername=<<WINDOWS-NODE-USERNAME>> \
--set secrets.windowsNodePassword=<<WINDOWS-NODE-PASSWORD>> \
logzio-otel-k8s-metrics logzio-helm/logzio-otel-k8s-metrics
```

* Replace `<<WINDOWS-NODE-USERNAME>>` with the username for the Node pool you want the Windows exporter to be installed on.

* Replace `<<WINDOWS-NODE-PASSWORD>>` with the password for the Node pool you want the Windows exporter to be installed on.

##### Check Logz.io for your metrics

Give your metrics some time to get from your system to ours, then open [Logz.io](https://app.logz.io/).


####  Customizing Helm chart parameters


##### Configure customization options

You can use the following options to update the Helm chart parameters: 

* Specify parameters using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`

* Edit the `values.yaml`

* Overide default values with your own `my_values.yaml` and apply it in the `helm install` command. 

###### Example:

```
helm install logzio-otel-k8s-metrics logzio-helm/logzio-otel-k8s-metrics -f my_values.yaml 
```

##### Customize the metrics collected by the Helm chart 

The default configuration uses the Prometheus receiver with the following scrape jobs:

* Cadvisor: Scrapes container metrics
* Kubernetes service endpoints: These jobs scrape metrics from the node exporters, from Kube state metrics, from any other service for which the `prometheus.io/scrape: true` annotaion is set, and from services that expose Prometheus metrics at the `/metrics` endpoint.

To customize your configuration, edit the `config` section in the `values.yaml` file.


#### Uninstalling the Chart

The uninstall command is used to remove all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and to delete the release.  

To uninstall the `logzio-otel-k8s-metrics` deployment, use the following command:

```shell
helm uninstall logzio-otel-k8s-metrics
```

## Sending logs from nodes with taints

If you want to ship logs from any of the nodes that have a taint, make sure that the taint key values are listed in your in your daemonset/deployment configuration as follows:

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: 
  operator: 
  value: 
  effect: 
```

To determine if a node uses taints as well as to display the taint keys, run:

```sh
kubectl get nodes -o json | jq ".items[]|{name:.metadata.name, taints:.spec.taints}"
```
